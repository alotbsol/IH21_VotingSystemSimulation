# IH21_VotingSystemSimulation

To run the program, make sure the dependencies are installed.

There are 2 scenarios which were used for data generation. Scenario 1 which was used for data generation of Section 3 (Impartial Culture) and Section 4 (One-Candidate Polarisation). And Scenario 2 which was used for data generation of section 5 (Multichoose Polarisation) and Section 6 (Effect of Multiple Votes). 

To run the program run either scenario_1.py or scenario_2.py. Under __name__ == '__main__' function a set up of the scenarios is visible. Number of iterations chosen for current scenarios is quite high and requires long computation. These can be adjusted under iterations variable. 

A simulation is started. Generated data are saved in the data folder in xlsx file and all graphs are generated and saved to graph folder.
