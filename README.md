# IH21_VotingSystemSimulation

To run the program, make sure the dependencies are installed.

There are 2 scenarios which were used for data generation. Scenario 1 which was used for data generation of section 3 (Impartial Culture) and Section 5 (1 candidate polarisation). And Scenario 2 which was used for data generation of section 6. 

To run the program run either scenario_1.py or scenario_2.py. Under __name__ == '__main__' function a set up of the scenarios is visible. Number of iterations chosen for current scenarios is quite high and requires long computation. These can be adjusted under iterations variable. 

A simulation is started. Generated data are saved in the xlsx file and all graphs are generated and saved to respective file.
